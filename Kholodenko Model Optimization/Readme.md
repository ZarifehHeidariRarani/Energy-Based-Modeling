# Negative or positive cooperativity of ShcP:

Based on the estimated parameters, it seems that the affinity of Shc for binding to EGFR intensively increases after phosphorylation, and it is in opposite of the original Kholodenko’s model.

K13= r13_k13f/ r13_k13b=0.057/10=0.0057

K15=r15_k15b/r15_k15f=1/1e-5=1e5


For original Kholodenko model we have:
r13_k13f = 0.09 
r13_k13b = 0.6 →                K13 = 0.15 

r15_k15f = 0.3 
r15_k15b = 0.0009               K15= 0.003
 
Based on these values, in the Kholodenko’s model, the affinity of Shc for binding to EGFR decreases after phosphorylation.
