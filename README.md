# Energy-Based-Modeling
In this repository, I upload the enrgy based models which has been created using BioNetGen.
The first model is the enrgy model of EGFR signaling pathway based on Kholodenko's paper.
# EGFR Model
We now have an Energy-Based model of the EGFR signaling pathway with 16 reaction rules and 40 parameters, compared to 25 reaction rules and 50 parameters in the original Kholodenko's model.
Both approaches produce similar results, with minor changes in some species.
The energy based modeling approach in order to recover the outputs of Kholodenko's model have been conducted in 4 steps:
# Step 1
Interactions between EGF, EGFR, and Shc
# Step 2
Interactions between EGF, EGFR, Shc, Grb2, and SOS. Without the Shc-Grb2 interaction.
# Step3
Interactions between EGF, EGFR, Shc, Grb2, and SOS. 
# Step 4
Interactions between EGF, EGFR, Shc, Grb2, SOS, and PLCg.
