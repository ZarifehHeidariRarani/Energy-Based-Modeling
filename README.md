# Energy-Based-Modeling
In this repository, I upload the enrgy based models which has been created using BioNetGen.
The first model is the enrgy model of EGFR signaling pathway based on Kholodenko's paper.
We now have an Energy-Based model of the EGFR signaling pathway with 16 reaction rules and 40 parameters, compared to 25 reaction rules and 50 parameters in the original Kholodenko's model.
Both approaches produce similar results, with minor changes in some species.
